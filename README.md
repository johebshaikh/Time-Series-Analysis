# Time-Series-Analysis

## Beer Production in the United States (1970-1977)
This project analyzes trends in beer production in the U.S. from 1970 to 1977. The analysis uses time series techniques to uncover patterns, including seasonality, trends, and variance changes in beer production during this period. A Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model is applied to predict future production.

## Data
- Source: Census At School New Zealand (link)
- Observations: 96 monthly records
- Main variable: beerproductionusa

## Analysis & Findings
- Trend: Beer production shows an upward trend over time.
- Seasonality: A repeating seasonal pattern is observed.
- Model: A SARIMA model is fitted to the data, indicating autocorrelation and moving average behavior.
- Prediction: The forecast shows an upward trend with increasing uncertainty over time.

## Conclusion
In this project, we performed a comprehensive time series analysis of beer production in the United States from 1970 to 1977. Using statistical techniques, we identified key patterns in the data, including a clear upward trend and the presence of seasonality, suggesting that beer production is influenced by recurring yearly cycles. This seasonality could be driven by factors like changing demand across different times of the year or improvements in brewing technology and distribution.

We applied a Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model to better understand the time series behavior, taking into account both the trend and seasonality. The model provided a reliable fit, allowing us to forecast future beer production. However, the prediction intervals widen over time, reflecting increased uncertainty, which may stem from unobserved variables or external shocks such as policy changes or economic factors.

Our results suggest that beer production is likely to continue growing in the near future, influenced by factors like the legalization of home brewing, the rise in the number of breweries, improved refrigeration, and distribution networks. The analysis underscores the importance of using seasonal models for time series data with such characteristics, as deterministic models would not capture the cyclical nature and long-term trends effectively.

By forecasting beer production, this project provides insights that could be valuable for stakeholders in the brewing industry, policymakers, and researchers. It highlights the role of historical data in making informed predictions and emphasizes the importance of ongoing developments in brewing technology and policy for shaping future production trends.
