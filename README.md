# Time-Series-Analysis

## Beer Production in the United States (1970-1977)
This project analyzes trends in beer production in the U.S. from 1970 to 1977. The analysis uses time series techniques to uncover patterns, including seasonality, trends, and variance changes in beer production during this period. A Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model is applied to predict future production.

## Data
- Source: Census At School New Zealand (link)
- Observations: 96 monthly records
- Main variable: beerproductionusa

## Analysis & Findings
- Trend: Beer production shows an upward trend over time.
- Seasonality: A repeating seasonal pattern is observed.
- Model: A SARIMA model is fitted to the data, indicating autocorrelation and moving average behavior.
- Prediction: The forecast shows an upward trend with increasing uncertainty over time.

## Conclusion
The analysis predicts continued growth in beer production, likely influenced by factors like the increasing number of breweries and improved storage methods.
